# GenshinCPU
This repo contains our CPU design(GenshinCPU) and project implementation for NSCSCC2021 competition. 
And we won the first prize in the finals.

**nscscc2021_group_qualifier_submission** folder has the code and projects(function , performance, system_test) if you have vivado , I'm sure you can open and run it. If you just want the bitstream, you can also find them in the **result** folder.

**nscscc2021_group_final_submission** folder has the similar structure.

**Code** folder has the code for the trivial and traditional five-stage cpu.

**Presentation**  folder includes our design report and our PPT for the final submission

**LICENSE** if you would like to use our codes, please see the license first.
